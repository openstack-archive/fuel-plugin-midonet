Known Limitations
-----------------

* The plugin has some limitations regarding node count scalability for NSDB
  (Network State Database) nodes. Once number of nodes with such role have been
  determined on initial deployment, it can not be changed. Controller and
  Compute role nodes are not affected by this limitation, current plugin
  version supports Controller and Compute scalability.

* Current version of plugin can only deploy single MidoNet Gareway role node.
  MidoNet itself supports any number of gateway nodes, it is only a plugin
  limitation, additional gateways needs to be set up manually.

Changes in MidoNet plugin |PluginVer|
-------------------------------------

* New features:

 * Support for Fuel |FuelVer|
 * Tasks are included in the ``deployment`` stage of Fuel instead of in the
   ``post_deployment``, so the time of deployment has decreased around 20-30
   minutes, as well as it makes the deployment more reliable.
 * **MidoNet** option available in the *Networking Setup* during the environment
   creation, making the configuration of an environment with MidoNet much
   easier.
