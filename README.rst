Mirantis Fuel MidoNet plugin
============================

Compatible versions:

- Mirantis Fuel 7.0
- MidoNet v2015.6
- Midokura Enterprise MidoNet 1.9

How to build the plugin
-----------------------

- Install Fuel plugin builder (fpb)

  ::

   # pip install fuel-plugin-builder

- Clone the plugin repo and run fpb there:

  ::

   $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/fuel-plugin-midonet
   $ cd fuel-plugin-midonet
   $ fpb --build .

A *rpm* called `midonet-fuel-plugin-4.0-4.0.0-1.noarch.rpm` should be created in
the same directory.

Follow the documentation to install and configure the plugin. You can read the
`rst` files in this very repository, or you can build a documentation file.

How to build the documentation
------------------------------

You need to have **Sphinx** installed in your computer. The Makefile provides
several target formats to do so. Go to the `doc` directory and run:

    make html

or:

    make pdf

You will need `rst2pdf` to run the latter.
